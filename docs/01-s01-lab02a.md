Here is your data:

   <td style="text-align:center;"> 28.38 </td>
   <td style="text-align:center;"> 2.88 </td>
  </tr>

</table>

Let's look at the main t-test formula:

$$t = \frac{\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2}{s_p \times \sqrt{\frac{1}{N_1} + \frac{1}{N_2}}}$$

Now, from the table above we know:

* the mean of Group A is $\bar{X_1} = 26.45$, 
* the mean of Group B is $\bar{X_2} = 28.38$, 
* the N of Group A is $N_1 = 47$, 
* and the N of Group B is $N_2 = 47$, 

which we can put into the equation right now:

$$t = \frac{26.45 - 28.38}{s_p \times \sqrt{\frac{1}{47} + \frac{1}{47}}}$$

And now we can see that the only thing we don't yet know is the pooled standard deviation ($s_p$). Let's look at that formula:

$$s_p = \sqrt{\frac{(n_1 -1)  \times s^2_{X_1} + (n_2 -1)\times s^2_{X_2}}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}}$$

And if we start to fill in some details:

$$s_p = \sqrt{\frac{(47 -1)  \times s^2_{X_1} + (47 -1)\times s^2_{X_2}}{47 + 47 - 2}}$$

Now looking at the formula, it is clear we are missing:

* $s^2_{X_1}$ - the variance of Group A (could be written as $s^2_{A}$)
* $s^2_{X_2}$ - the variance of Group B (could be written as $s^2_{B}$) 

What we do know though, from the table, is the standard deviations of both groups ($SD_A$ = 2.44; $SD_B$ = 2.88), and we know that variance of a group is equal to the standard deviation squared. So:

* $s^2_{X_1}$ = $s^2_A$ = $SD_A \times SD_A$ = $2.44 \times 2.44$ = $5.9536$
* $s^2_{X_2}$ = $s^2_B$ = $SD_B \times SD_B$ = $2.88 \times 2.88$ = $8.2944$

And if we now add those values to our formula we get:

$$s_p = \sqrt{\frac{(47 -1)  \times 5.9536 + (47 -1)\times 8.2944}{47 + 47 - 2}}$$

And we can then start working through the formula, taking each stage in turn to make sure we don't make mistakes. Let's get rid of the brackets first:

$$s_p = \sqrt{\frac{(46  \times 5.9536) + (46 \times 8.2944)}{92}}$$

Now we deal with the multiplications:

$$s_p = \sqrt{\frac{273.8656 + 381.5424}{92}}$$

Let's tidy up that top half of the equation (the numerator):

$$s_p = \sqrt{\frac{655.408}{92}}$$

Which if we then divide the numerator by the denominator (the bottom half), and then take the square root of that we get:

$$s_p = \sqrt{7.124}$$ 

Giving a pooled standard deviation of:

$$s_p = 2.6690822$$

Meaning that our pooled standard deviation, rounded to three decimal places, is $s_p = 2.669$ and we can now add that to the t-test formula to give us:

$$t = \frac{26.45 - 28.38}{2.669 \times \sqrt{\frac{1}{47} + \frac{1}{47}}}$$

And again we just start working through the formula. Let's deal with the fractions relating to sample size first:

$$t = \frac{26.45 - 28.38}{2.669 \times \sqrt{0.0212766 + 0.0212766}}$$

Which we can tidy up a little to give:

$$t = \frac{-1.93}{2.669 \times \sqrt{0.0425532}}$$

And if we sort out the square root on the denominator we are left with:

$$t = \frac{-1.93}{2.669 \times 0.2062842}$$

We can then tidy up the denominator to give us:

$$t = \frac{-1.93}{0.5505727}$$

Which we can finally solve to give us a t-value, rounded to two decimal places, of $t = -3.51$

Great! Now we just need the degrees of freedom where the formula is:

$$df = (n_1 - 1) + (n_2 - 1)$$

And we already know that:

* the N of Group A is $N_1 = 47$, 
* and the N of Group B is $N_2 = 47$, 

So putting them into the equation we get:

$$df = (47 - 1) + (47 - 1)$$
$$df = 46 + 46$$
$$df = 92$$

And finally Cohen's d, the effect size:

$$d = \frac{2t}{\sqrt{df}}$$

Which, based on the info above, we know:

* $t = -3.51$
* $df = 92$

Putting them into the formula we get:

$$d = \frac{2 \times -3.51}{\sqrt{92}}$$

And if we tidy the nominator and the denominator we get:

$$d = \frac{-7.02}{9.591663}$$

Which we can then resolve to learn that $d = -0.73$

**Determining Significance**

If we were to look at a critical values look-up table for $df = 92$ and $\alpha = .05$ (two-tailed), we would see that the critical value is $t_{crit} = 1.986$. Given that our t-value, ignoring polarity and just looking at the absolute value, so $t = 3.51$, is equal to or larger than our $t_{crit}$ then we can say our result is significant, and as such would be written up as t(92) = 3.51, p < .05, d = 0.73

**Remember:** If you were writing this up as a report, and analysis the data in R, then you would see the p-value was actually p = 6.9591098\times 10^{-4}, and would be written up as p < .001

Let's look at the main t-test formula:

$$t = \frac{\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2}{s_p \times \sqrt{\frac{1}{N_1} + \frac{1}{N_2}}}$$

Now, from the table above we know:

* the mean of Group A is $\bar{X_1} = 13.13$, 
* the mean of Group B is $\bar{X_2} = 14.06$, 
* the N of Group A is $N_1 = 48$, 
* and the N of Group B is $N_2 = 48$, 

which we can put into the equation right now:

$$t = \frac{13.13 - 14.06}{s_p \times \sqrt{\frac{1}{48} + \frac{1}{48}}}$$

And now we can see that the only thing we don't yet know is the pooled standard deviation ($s_p$). Let's look at that formula:

$$s_p = \sqrt{\frac{(n_1 -1)  \times s^2_{X_1} + (n_2 -1)\times s^2_{X_2}}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}}$$

And if we start to fill in some details:

$$s_p = \sqrt{\frac{(48 -1)  \times s^2_{X_1} + (48 -1)\times s^2_{X_2}}{48 + 48 - 2}}$$

Now looking at the formula, it is clear we are missing:

* $s^2_{X_1}$ - the variance of Group A (could be written as $s^2_{A}$)
* $s^2_{X_2}$ - the variance of Group B (could be written as $s^2_{B}$) 

What we do know though, from the table, is the standard deviations of both groups ($SD_A$ = 2.28; $SD_B$ = 2.43), and we know that variance of a group is equal to the standard deviation squared. So:

* $s^2_{X_1}$ = $s^2_A$ = $SD_A \times SD_A$ = $2.28 \times 2.28$ = $5.1984$
* $s^2_{X_2}$ = $s^2_B$ = $SD_B \times SD_B$ = $2.43 \times 2.43$ = $5.9049$

And if we now add those values to our formula we get:

$$s_p = \sqrt{\frac{(48 -1)  \times 5.1984 + (48 -1)\times 5.9049}{48 + 48 - 2}}$$

And we can then start working through the formula, taking each stage in turn to make sure we don't make mistakes. Let's get rid of the brackets first:

$$s_p = \sqrt{\frac{(47  \times 5.1984) + (47 \times 5.9049)}{94}}$$

Now we deal with the multiplications:

$$s_p = \sqrt{\frac{244.3248 + 277.5303}{94}}$$

Let's tidy up that top half of the equation (the numerator):

$$s_p = \sqrt{\frac{521.8551}{94}}$$

Which if we then divide the numerator by the denominator (the bottom half), and then take the square root of that we get:

$$s_p = \sqrt{5.55165}$$ 

Giving a pooled standard deviation of:

$$s_p = 2.356194$$

Meaning that our pooled standard deviation, rounded to three decimal places, is $s_p = 2.356$ and we can now add that to the t-test formula to give us:

$$t = \frac{13.13 - 14.06}{2.356 \times \sqrt{\frac{1}{48} + \frac{1}{48}}}$$

And again we just start working through the formula. Let's deal with the fractions relating to sample size first:

$$t = \frac{13.13 - 14.06}{2.356 \times \sqrt{0.0208333 + 0.0208333}}$$

Which we can tidy up a little to give:

$$t = \frac{-0.93}{2.356 \times \sqrt{0.0416667}}$$

And if we sort out the square root on the denominator we are left with:

$$t = \frac{-0.93}{2.356 \times 0.2041241}$$

We can then tidy up the denominator to give us:

$$t = \frac{-0.93}{0.4809165}$$

Which we can finally solve to give us a t-value, rounded to two decimal places, of $t = -1.93$

Great! Now we just need the degrees of freedom where the formula is:

$$df = (n_1 - 1) + (n_2 - 1)$$

And we already know that:

* the N of Group A is $N_1 = 48$, 
* and the N of Group B is $N_2 = 48$, 

So putting them into the equation we get:

$$df = (48 - 1) + (48 - 1)$$
$$df = 47 + 47$$
$$df = 94$$

And finally Cohen's d, the effect size:

$$d = \frac{2t}{\sqrt{df}}$$

Which, based on the info above, we know:

* $t = -1.93$
* $df = 94$

Putting them into the formula we get:

$$d = \frac{2 \times -1.93}{\sqrt{94}}$$

And if we tidy the nominator and the denominator we get:

$$d = \frac{-3.86}{9.6953597}$$

Which we can then resolve to learn that $d = -0.4$

**Determining Significance**

If we were to look at a critical values look-up table for $df = 94$ and $\alpha = .05$ (two-tailed), we would see that the critical value is $t_{crit} = 1.986$. Given that our t-value, ignoring polarity and just looking at the absolute value, so $t = 1.93$, is smaller than our $t_{crit}$ then we can say our result is non-significant, and as such would be written up as t(94) = 1.93, p > .05, d = 0.4

**Remember:** If you were writing this up as a report, and analysis the data in R, then you would see the p-value was actually p = 0.0566217, and would be written up as p =  0.057

* and the N of Group B is $N_2 = 17$, 

which we can put into the equation right now:

$$t = \frac{12.93 - 12.47}{s_p \times \sqrt{\frac{1}{17} + \frac{1}{17}}}$$

And now we can see that the only thing we don't yet know is the pooled standard deviation ($s_p$). Let's look at that formula:

$$s_p = \sqrt{\frac{(n_1 -1)  \times s^2_{X_1} + (n_2 -1)\times s^2_{X_2}}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}}$$

And if we start to fill in some details:

$$s_p = \sqrt{\frac{(17 -1)  \times s^2_{X_1} + (17 -1)\times s^2_{X_2}}{17 + 17 - 2}}$$

Now looking at the formula, it is clear we are missing:

* $s^2_{X_1}$ - the variance of Group A (could be written as $s^2_{A}$)
* $s^2_{X_2}$ - the variance of Group B (could be written as $s^2_{B}$) 

What we do know though, from the table, is the standard deviations of both groups ($SD_A$ = 1.33; $SD_B$ = 1.67), and we know that variance of a group is equal to the standard deviation squared. So:

* $s^2_{X_1}$ = $s^2_A$ = $SD_A \times SD_A$ = $1.33 \times 1.33$ = $1.7689$
* $s^2_{X_2}$ = $s^2_B$ = $SD_B \times SD_B$ = $1.67 \times 1.67$ = $2.7889$

And if we now add those values to our formula we get:

$$s_p = \sqrt{\frac{(17 -1)  \times 1.7689 + (17 -1)\times 2.7889}{17 + 17 - 2}}$$

And we can then start working through the formula, taking each stage in turn to make sure we don't make mistakes. Let's get rid of the brackets first:

$$s_p = \sqrt{\frac{(16  \times 1.7689) + (16 \times 2.7889)}{32}}$$

Now we deal with the multiplications:

$$s_p = \sqrt{\frac{28.3024 + 44.6224}{32}}$$

Let's tidy up that top half of the equation (the numerator):

$$s_p = \sqrt{\frac{72.9248}{32}}$$

Which if we then divide the numerator by the denominator (the bottom half), and then take the square root of that we get:

$$s_p = \sqrt{2.2789}$$ 

Giving a pooled standard deviation of:

$$s_p = 1.5096026$$

Meaning that our pooled standard deviation, rounded to three decimal places, is $s_p = 1.51$ and we can now add that to the t-test formula to give us:

$$t = \frac{12.93 - 12.47}{1.51 \times \sqrt{\frac{1}{17} + \frac{1}{17}}}$$

And again we just start working through the formula. Let's deal with the fractions relating to sample size first:

Which we can tidy up a little to give:

$$t = \frac{0.46}{1.51 \times \sqrt{0.1176471}}$$

And if we sort out the square root on the denominator we are left with:

$$t = \frac{0.46}{1.51 \times 0.3429972}$$

We can then tidy up the denominator to give us:

$$t = \frac{0.46}{0.5179257}$$

Which we can finally solve to give us a t-value, rounded to two decimal places, of $t = 0.89$

Great! Now we just need the degrees of freedom where the formula is:

$$df = (n_1 - 1) + (n_2 - 1)$$

And we already know that:

* the N of Group A is $N_1 = 17$, 
* and the N of Group B is $N_2 = 17$, 

So putting them into the equation we get:

$$df = (17 - 1) + (17 - 1)$$
$$df = 16 + 16$$
$$df = 32$$

And finally Cohen's d, the effect size:

$$d = \frac{2t}{\sqrt{df}}$$

Which, based on the info above, we know:

* $t = 0.89$
* $df = 32$

Putting them into the formula we get:

$$d = \frac{2 \times 0.89}{\sqrt{32}}$$

And if we tidy the nominator and the denominator we get:

$$d = \frac{1.78}{5.6568542}$$

Which we can then resolve to learn that $d = 0.31$

**Determining Significance**

If we were to look at a critical values look-up table for $df = 32$ and $\alpha = .05$ (two-tailed), we would see that the critical value is $t_{crit} = 2.037$. Given that our t-value, ignoring polarity and just looking at the absolute value, so $t = 0.89$, is smaller than our $t_{crit}$ then we can say our result is non-significant, and as such would be written up as t(32) = 0.89, p > .05, d = 0.31

Let's look at the main t-test formula:

$$t = \frac{\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2}{s_p \times \sqrt{\frac{1}{N_1} + \frac{1}{N_2}}}$$

Now, from the table above we know:

* the mean of Group A is $\bar{X_1} = 53.99$, 
* the mean of Group B is $\bar{X_2} = 53.3$, 
* the N of Group A is $N_1 = 23$, 
* and the N of Group B is $N_2 = 23$, 

which we can put into the equation right now:

$$t = \frac{53.99 - 53.3}{s_p \times \sqrt{\frac{1}{23} + \frac{1}{23}}}$$

And now we can see that the only thing we don't yet know is the pooled standard deviation ($s_p$). Let's look at that formula:

$$s_p = \sqrt{\frac{(n_1 -1)  \times s^2_{X_1} + (n_2 -1)\times s^2_{X_2}}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}}$$

And if we start to fill in some details:

$$s_p = \sqrt{\frac{(23 -1)  \times s^2_{X_1} + (23 -1)\times s^2_{X_2}}{23 + 23 - 2}}$$

Now looking at the formula, it is clear we are missing:

* $s^2_{X_1}$ - the variance of Group A (could be written as $s^2_{A}$)
* $s^2_{X_2}$ - the variance of Group B (could be written as $s^2_{B}$) 

What we do know though, from the table, is the standard deviations of both groups ($SD_A$ = 4.37; $SD_B$ = 3.29), and we know that variance of a group is equal to the standard deviation squared. So:

* $s^2_{X_1}$ = $s^2_A$ = $SD_A \times SD_A$ = $4.37 \times 4.37$ = $19.0969$
* $s^2_{X_2}$ = $s^2_B$ = $SD_B \times SD_B$ = $3.29 \times 3.29$ = $10.8241$

And if we now add those values to our formula we get:

$$s_p = \sqrt{\frac{(23 -1)  \times 19.0969 + (23 -1)\times 10.8241}{23 + 23 - 2}}$$

And we can then start working through the formula, taking each stage in turn to make sure we don't make mistakes. Let's get rid of the brackets first:

$$s_p = \sqrt{\frac{(22  \times 19.0969) + (22 \times 10.8241)}{44}}$$

Now we deal with the multiplications:

$$s_p = \sqrt{\frac{420.1318 + 238.1302}{44}}$$

Let's tidy up that top half of the equation (the numerator):

$$s_p = \sqrt{\frac{658.262}{44}}$$

Which if we then divide the numerator by the denominator (the bottom half), and then take the square root of that we get:

$$s_p = \sqrt{14.9605}$$ 

Giving a pooled standard deviation of:

$$s_p = 3.8678806$$

Meaning that our pooled standard deviation, rounded to three decimal places, is $s_p = 3.868$ and we can now add that to the t-test formula to give us:

$$t = \frac{53.99 - 53.3}{3.868 \times \sqrt{\frac{1}{23} + \frac{1}{23}}}$$

And again we just start working through the formula. Let's deal with the fractions relating to sample size first:

$$t = \frac{53.99 - 53.3}{3.868 \times \sqrt{0.0434783 + 0.0434783}}$$

Which we can tidy up a little to give:

$$t = \frac{0.69}{3.868 \times \sqrt{0.0869565}}$$

And if we sort out the square root on the denominator we are left with:

$$t = \frac{0.69}{3.868 \times 0.2948839}$$

We can then tidy up the denominator to give us:

$$t = \frac{0.69}{1.140611}$$

Which we can finally solve to give us a t-value, rounded to two decimal places, of $t = 0.6$

Great! Now we just need the degrees of freedom where the formula is:

$$df = (n_1 - 1) + (n_2 - 1)$$

And we already know that:

* the N of Group A is $N_1 = 23$, 
* and the N of Group B is $N_2 = 23$, 

So putting them into the equation we get:

$$df = (23 - 1) + (23 - 1)$$
$$df = 22 + 22$$
$$df = 44$$

And finally Cohen's d, the effect size:

$$d = \frac{2t}{\sqrt{df}}$$

Which, based on the info above, we know:

* $t = 0.6$
* $df = 44$

Putting them into the formula we get:

$$d = \frac{2 \times 0.6}{\sqrt{44}}$$

And if we tidy the nominator and the denominator we get:

$$d = \frac{1.2}{6.6332496}$$

Which we can then resolve to learn that $d = 0.18$

**Determining Significance**

If we were to look at a critical values look-up table for $df = 44$ and $\alpha = .05$ (two-tailed), we would see that the critical value is $t_{crit} = 2.015$. Given that our t-value, ignoring polarity and just looking at the absolute value, so $t = 0.6$, is smaller than our $t_{crit}$ then we can say our result is non-significant, and as such would be written up as t(44) = 0.6, p > .05, d = 0.18

**Remember:** If you were writing this up as a report, and analysis the data in R, then you would see the p-value was actually p = 0.551584, and would be written up as p =  0.543

## Look-Up table

Remembering that the $t_{crit}$ value is the smallest t-value you need to find a significant effect, find the $t_{crit}$ for your df, assuming $\alpha = .05$. If the $t-value$ you calculated is equal to or larger than $t_{crit}$ then your test is significant.

|df | $\alpha = .05$|
|:-:|:-------------:|
|5  |2.571|
|10 |2.228|
|15 |2.131|
|20 |2.086|
|30 |2.042|
|40 |2.021|
|50 |2.009|
|60 |2|
|70 |1.994|
|80 |1.99|
|90 |1.987|
|100|1.984|
