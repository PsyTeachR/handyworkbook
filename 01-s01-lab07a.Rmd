# ANOVA

This chapter is currently under development but will eventually show how to complete ANOVAs and ANOVA tables by hand.

## The ANOVA table

**Scenario:** A research team are investigating the influence of mainstream media on body image and self-esteem. First they record a number of variables from a large cohort of men (n = 72) and
women (n = 81) including ratings of self-esteem (from 10, low to 40, high), BMI (normal weight considered 18.5 to 24.9), hours spent per week on social media
(hours), and age (years). The researchers want to check the influence of sex in this study. Calculate F from the below one-way ANOVA output table comparing mean BMI across the two sexes and state whether there is a significant difference between
the sexes or not. The Sums of Squares ($SS$) have been given to you.

```{r vals, echo = FALSE}
BSS <- 44.56
WSS <- 2126.3
```

|Conditions|$SS$| $df$ |Mean Square|F-value
|:--------:|:-------------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Between   |`r BSS`||||
|Within    |`r WSS`||||
|Total     |`r BSS+WSS`||||

In order to complete the above table we need to:

* determine the degrees of freedom ($df$) of the Between and the Within components
* use the $df$ to calculate the Mean Squares ($MS$)
* use the Mean Squares to calculate the F-value

The df of the Between component is calculated as:

$$df_{between} = k - 1$$

Where $k$ is the number of conditions or groups. And the df of the Within component is calculated as:

$$df_{within} = N - k$$

Where $N$ is total number of participants in the whole experiment and $k$ is again the number of conditions or groups. The $df_{within}$ can also be phrased as the:

$$df_{within} = \sum_1^k(n_{k}-1)$$

Which can be read as taking 1 away from the n in each group ($k$) and then summing those values together. For example, if you had a total of 20 participants in your experiment ($N = 20$) and they were split into 2 groups ($k = 2$) of 10 per group ($n = 10$), then you would do:

$$df_{within} = (10-1)+(10-1) = `r 10-1+10-1`$$

But as that is the same as $N-k$ (i.e. 20 - 2 = 18), and $N-k$ is easier to think about, we will use that approach here. 

The remaining formulas we need are for the Mean Squares ($MS$) and the $F$-value.

The Mean Squares is calculated as:

$$MS = \frac{SS}{df}$$

And the F-value is calculated as:

$$F= \frac{MS_{between}}{MS_{within}}$$


## Look-Up table

Remembering that the $F_{crit}$ value is the smallest t-value you need to find a significant effect, find the $F_{crit}$ for your dfs, assuming $\alpha = .05$. If the $F$-value you calculated is equal to or larger than $F_{crit}$ then your test is significant.
